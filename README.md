# Livdin

## Description 


Livdin is a web application that lets users post reviews on previous and current place of residence. The application is being designed with the idea of giving individuals a space to review their current place of residence free from the real estate pressure. Reviews can contain information such as expressing opinion of previous or current place of residence, how landlords handle maintaince issues, how expense utilities bills range etc.

* Zillow API (possibly another real estate api)
* MapQuest API (to look up address of user input)
* Express Library
* Node 
* SQL database (handles user log in information and review posts)
* Sequelize
* Passport (node module that uses the middleware design pattern to authenticate requests.)
* bcrypt (offers salt hashing to further protect passwords in database)

## Tasks Break Down 02.04.2020 (remove for final readme.MD)

__Kurt__: play with the wireframe of the front end, and begin       connecting html pages with javascript interactions.  

__Ryan__: figure out real estate API, be able to make calls from Zillow or another real estate API  

__Dan__: begin creating our first model. Either handle reviews or check how our user log in information is being stored  

__Leo__: work with mapquest API, and be able to look up any address you want.
